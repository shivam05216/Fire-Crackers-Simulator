**🎆 Firecracker Simulation** – Realistic Fireworks Show (HTML, CSS, JS)

Welcome to the Firecracker Simulation, a dynamic web-based fireworks experience built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project creates an interactive and visually captivating fireworks display where you can customize the type, color, behavior, and intensity of firecracker explosions — all rendered beautifully on your browser screen! 💥

**✨ Features**

🎇 Realistic Firecracker Simulation – colorful particle effects with gravity, fade, and burst animation.
💫 Customizable Settings Panel – adjust:
Shell Type (Ring, Heart, Star, Key, etc.)
Explosion Shape and Spread
Brightness & Sky Background
Explosion Density and Quality
Launch Speed, Gravity Strength
Auto-blast (automatic firing) mode
Fullscreen Mode toggle

🔄 Auto Fireworks Mode – sit back and enjoy the show automatically.

🌈 Multi-Color Particle Blasts – beautiful and smooth color gradients.

⚙️ User Controls – tweak parameters live to create your own fireworks show.

📱 Responsive Design – works across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

**🧠 How It Works**
The entire simulation is powered by HTML5 Canvas API and JavaScript animation loops.

**🔹 Core Concepts Used**

Canvas Rendering Context (2D) – for drawing and animating particles.

Physics Simulation – applied rules of gravity, velocity, and friction.

Color Transitions – controlled with HSL/RGB manipulation.

Object-Oriented JS – separate classes for particles, shells, explosions, and simulation control.

Real-time Interaction – input events for sliders, dropdowns, and checkboxes to dynamically update settings.

**🧩 Technologies Used**
HTML5 :   	Structure of the simulation and UI controls
CSS3	 :    Layout, themes, animations, and responsiveness
JavaScript: Core simulation logic, physics, customization, and rendering
Canvas API:	Drawing fireworks particles and explosion animations
LocalStorage:	Save user preferences like shell type or brightness
DOM Events & Custom Handlers: Handle user interaction dynamically

This project is a creative blend of art, code, and physics, showcasing how much can be achieved using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
without relying on external libraries or frameworks. It brings the magic of fireworks to life through mathematical precision and visual creativity.

By simulating real-world physics — gravity, velocity, particle motion, and light fading — it delivers a realistic firecracker experience right in the browser. 
Beyond being visually appealing, it demonstrates how developers can push the boundaries of what’s possible with vanilla web technologies.

The project is more than just a fun simulation — it’s an exploration of creative coding, problem-solving, and the beauty of visual programming.
Whether you’re a beginner learning canvas animations or an experienced developer looking for inspiration,
this project is a reminder that even the simplest tools can create something spectacular.
